# SentinelX: GenAI-Powered Malware Analysis Engine 🛡️


**SentinelX** is a next-generation malware sandbox that bridges the gap between static signature matching and heuristic behavioral profiling. Unlike traditional sandboxes, SentinelX uses a **Hybrid Detection Engine** combining industry-standard **YARA** scanning with an **LLM Agent (Gemini 2.5 Flash)** to interpret file anomalies and *autonomously synthesize* new YARA rules for zero-day threats.

## 🏗️ Architecture 

### Full-Stack Implementation
* **Frontend:** React 19, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Shadcn UI (Theme with Dark/Light mode).
* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11) microservices architecture.
* **Database:** MongoDB (via Motor) for storing scan results, YARA rules, and threat intel.
* **AI Engine:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash via `google-genai` SDK.
* **Static Engine:** YARA-Python for high-speed signature matching.

### Core Pipelines
1.  **Ingestion & Pre-processing:** Secure file upload handling and metadata extraction.
2.  **Static Analysis:** Instant scanning against a local database of 50,000+ YARA signatures.
3.  **AI Heuristics:** If static analysis fails, Gemini 2.5 analyzes string entropy, API calls, and code structure.
4.  **Autonomous Synthesis:** If a threat is confirmed, the AI *writes and compiles* a valid YARA rule to block future variants.
5.  **Global Intelligence:** Automated syncing with AlienVault OTX, MalwareBazaar, and ReversingLabs repositories.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🛡️ Hybrid Detection**: Combines the speed of signatures with the reasoning of Large Language Models.
- **🧠 Zero-Shot Rule Generation**: Automatically creates YARA rules for unknown threats without human intervention.
- **🌍 Multi-Source Threat Intel**: One-click sync from GitHub, OTX, and MalwareBazaar.
- **📊Dashboard**: Real-time scanning visualization, "AI Logic" pipeline view, and downloadable rule management.
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Professional commercial-grade interface with full Dark/Light theme support.
